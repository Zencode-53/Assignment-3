🧮 Python Basics Practice – Factorial & Math Functions

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python tasks created to understand loops, functions, user input, and the math module.
These tasks are perfect for anyone who is starting their Python journey and wants to build strong fundamentals. 😊

📌 Task 1: Factorial of a Number
🔹 What is this task about?

In this task, we calculate the factorial of a given number using a function and a loop.

👉 The factorial of a number n is the multiplication of all numbers from n down to 1.

Example:
Factorial of 5
5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

🔹 How this program works

The program asks the user to enter a number.
A variable b is initialized with 1 (because factorial multiplication starts from 1).
A for loop runs from the given number down to 1.
Each number is multiplied with b.
Finally, the program prints the factorial result.

🔹 Concepts used

Functions (def)
User input (input())
Type conversion (int)
for loop
Basic multiplication logic

🔹 Sample Output
Enter the number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120

📌 Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using math Module
🔹 What is this task about?

In this task, we use Python’s built-in math module to perform common mathematical operations on a number.

The program calculates:

Square root
Logarithm
Sine value

🔹 How this program works

The user enters a number.
The math module is imported.

The program uses:
math.sqrt() to find the square root
math.log() to find the natural logarithm
math.sin() to find the sine of the number

All results are printed clearly.

🔹 Concepts used

math module
Mathematical functions
User input
Formatted output (f-string)

🔹 Sample Output
Enter a number: 10
Square root: 3.1622776601683795
Logarithm: 2.302585092994046
Sine: -0.5440211108893698

🚀 How to Run the Programs

Make sure Python is installed.
Clone this repository.
Run the Python file using:
python filename.py


Enter the input when asked.

🤝 Final Note

These tasks are part of my learning process as I explore Python fundamentals.
Feel free to use, modify, or improve the code.
